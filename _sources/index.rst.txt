Ripser
========

This package provides the awesome Ripser project as an easy to use Python module. It is easy to install and is even easier to use.

For the original C++ library, see `Ripser/ripser <https://github.com/Ripser/ripser/releases/latest>`_.


Setup
------

Installation requires Cython, and currently must be installed from source. An example of how to install is

.. code:: python

    pip install Cython
    pip install Ripser


We use matplotlib for generating persistence diagrams


Usage
------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from ripser import ripser, plot_dgms

    data = np.random.random((100,2))
    diagrams = ripser(data)['dgms']
    plot_dgms(diagrams, show=True)



Note that there is also a <i>Rips</i> object with the same functionality, which conforms to the Scikit-learn API.

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    from ripser import Rips
    r = Rips()

    data = np.random.random((100,2))
    diagram = r.fit_transform(data)
    r.plot(diagram, show=True)
